# Dev-Spot

“The intuitive collaborative platform that allows developers to grow together through projects ”

**Problem**: Giving developers the opportunity to learn and collaborate on real-world projects, improving their portfolios, and providing a platform for them to increase their online presence and experiences.

**Story**:  Many students graduate with 4-year CS degrees and have a hard time finding jobs as they lack hands-on experience with the technologies that they studied. Every software engineer must keep their tools sharp by practicing and developing their skills through every-day code.  DevSpot is a tool to spark inspiration in developers.  Our vision, as GA students who learned immensely from working on projects, is to create an environment that allows for learning and building experience.  DevSpot also gives inspiration to developers who have cultivated knowledge of various tech stacks that they want to practice and improve!

**Slogan**: “Create, Collab, Connect”
